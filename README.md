# Software-Module-Of-Clustering-Analysis

## DESIGNING THE MODULE FOR CLUSTER ANALYSIS
### General Description
The software shall be designed for students studying the clustering methods in their university courses so, the intended users of software are university students and their teachers.
As a rule, during their classes students first study the methods then solve tasks using manual calculations or software such as Ms Excel so they need special software to:
-	check the results of their manual calculations.
-	after studying clustering methods, us them to solve data analysis tasks.

### Mathematical Procedures

#### Example of cluster analysis task
We shall describe methods to be used by students and implemented in software using the following example
We analyze data about nine countries:

| Country                                  | C1  | C2  | C3  |  C4  |  C5 |  C6 | C7  | C8  | C9  |
| ---                                      | --- | --- | --- | ---  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Income per capita (thousand Euro)         | 2.6 | 2.8 | 1.1 |	4.2 |	3.9 |	4.1 |	1.3	| 1.9	| 3.7 |
|Population having university education (%)| 19  | 23  | 17  |  30  |	 30 |  35	| 20  | 24	| 32  |

Use K-means algorithm to subdivide the countries into the groups: 1) high income, high proportion of population having university education; 2) low income, low proportion of population having university education; 3) average income, average proportion of population having university education.
Use the maximin algorithm to subdivide the countries into the groups. Interpret the resulting subdivision.
