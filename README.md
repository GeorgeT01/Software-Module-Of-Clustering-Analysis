# Software-Module-Of-Clustering-Analysis

## DESIGNING THE MODULE FOR CLUSTER ANALYSIS
### General Description
The software shall be designed for students studying the clustering methods in their university courses so, the intended users of software are university students and their teachers.
As a rule, during their classes students first study the methods then solve tasks using manual calculations or software such as Ms Excel so they need special software to:
-	check the results of their manual calculations.
-	after studying clustering methods, us them to solve data analysis tasks.

### Mathematical Procedures

#### Example of cluster analysis task
We shall describe methods to be used by students and implemented in software using the following example
We analyze information about nine companies: C1, C2, â€¦, C9.
| Companies  | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | C8 | C9 |
|Income per capita (thousand Euro)| 2.6	| 2.8 |	1.1 |	4.2 |	3.9 |	4.1 |	1.3	| 1.9	| 3.7 |
|Population having university education (%)|19	| 23| 17 | 30 |	30 | 35	| 20 | 24	| 32|
